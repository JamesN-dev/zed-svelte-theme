# Svelte 5 Gang - A Theme for Zed

A high-contrast, Svelte-branded dark theme for Zed inspired by the [official Svelte documentation.](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction).

This theme features the iconic Svelte orange (#FF3E00) with a deep black background for reduced eye strain.

## Manual install

1. Copy `Svelte-5-Gang-Theme.json` into `~/.config/zed/themes`
2. Select your theme (Settings -> Select Theme)

## Recommended Settings

For the best experience with this theme, add the following to your settings.json file:

```
"indent_guides": {
  "enabled": true,
  "coloring": "indent_aware",
  "background_coloring": "indent_aware",
  "line_width": 1,
  "active_line_width": 2
}
```

This will enable orange-tinted alternating indent guides that complement the theme's Svelte branding, similar to the code blocks on the Svelte documentation.
